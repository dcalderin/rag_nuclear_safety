Storage can be used to take advantage of radioactive decay in order to meet clearance levels (see para. 4.19 of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 5, Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste [10], and the example provided in Annex IV to this Safety Guide). 3.2. The clearance process should consider the requirements of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR‑6 (Rev. 1), Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, 2018 Edition [16]. Table 2 of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16] specifies activity concentration limits for exempt material, which are higher than the generic clearance levels specified in tables I.2 and I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1]. Thus, any material that has been cleared on the basis of these generic activity concentration clearance levels will be exempt from the requirements of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16]. CONSIDERATION OF CLEARANCE FOR MATERIALS CONTAINING MORE THAN ONE RADIONUCLIDE 3.3. As part of the clearance process, the radionuclide composition of the material should be determined through a process of characterization. The result should be a list of the radionuclides present and their contribution to the total activity concentration or surface contamination level. The different processes that have contributed to the presence of radionuclides in the waste (e.g. nuclear fission, activation by particles, contamination) should also be identified. 3.4.

One of the principal criteria for clearance in relation to radionuclides of artificial origin is that in reasonably foreseeable circumstances the effective dose expected to be incurred by any individual due to the cleared material is of the order of 10 μSv or less in a year (see para. I.11 of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards [IX–1]). IX–2. There are five components to the practical application of clearance, each of which includes a degree of conservatism, as follows: (a) Application of the dose criterion for clearance to an individual practice; (b) Conversion from the dose criterion to activity concentration (Bq/g); (c) Margins associated with practical clearance measurements; (d) Taking account of multiple radionuclides — radionuclide composition and summation rules; (e) Activity distribution in cleared material.

The regulatory body should determine or approve appropriate averaging masses to be used in the clearance process, in particular for compliance measurements; the averaging procedures used by the operating organization should take these averaging masses into account. Examples of appropriate averaging masses are from a few hundred kilograms to the order of a tonne. The regulatory body should confirm that the averaging procedure is not used solely to allow material that contains radioactivity above the clearance levels to be cleared. The operating organization should ensure that averaging procedures, selected in accordance with the type of material, are an integral part of the clearance process. For small objects with a mass less than the specified averaging mass, a minimum default averaging mass (e.g. 1 kg) could be defined by the regulatory body, which in turn allows the specification of a maximum total activity for these objects for a specified radionuclide (e.g. 100 Bq for 60Co) or radionuclide composition. It should be ensured that this does not result in large objects being divided into smaller ones solely as a means of achieving clearance. In the case of several small objects, an alternative method would be to monitor them together to replicate the averaging mass. 4.25. In the case of surface contamination clearance levels, the regulatory body should consider, depending on the type of material, and the nature and homogeneity of the contamination, averaging areas from several hundred square centimetres up to 1 m2.

Some of the recommendations are still valid for smaller quantities of cleared material and should be applied in accordance with a graded approach. 3.26.	The operating organization should ensure that staff implementing the clearance process are clearly identified and are suitably qualified, properly trained and competent for their roles. The number of staff should be commensurate with the quantities of material to be handled and the capacity of the associated monitoring programme. 3.27.	Additional staff may be needed to record information on material undergoing the clearance process, for example by updating databases on the material and maintaining documentation. Staff may also be needed to ensure continued movement of the material through the steps of the clearance process and segregation of material that has been cleared. 24",42,file:///private/var/folders/1y/lclhr1bn1_b78zjjhqs572mc0000gn/T/gradio/200a7b0092a9b8794864bb354529c4757d299729811eaa5dfc1d84ab62525afa/PUB2058_web_gsg_18.pdf#page=42,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],0.0787352
52,"in para. I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] is not appropriate for clearance of materials containing radionuclides of natural origin. Instead, the activity concentration of each radionuclide of natural origin should be compared with the clearance levels in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1], and if each one is less than or equal to the clearance level then the material can be cleared. For example, for a material containing radionuclides from the 238U decay chain, the clearance level of 1 Bq/g would apply to each radionuclide present. Where the secular equilibrium is significantly disturbed (e.g. owing to thermal processes) or only parts of the decay chain are present, use of the clearance levels given in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] might be too restrictive. In such cases, the regulatory body or operating organization might derive more appropriate values (i.e. specific clearance). 3.8. For clearance of solid bulk material containing a mixture of radionuclides of natural origin and radionuclides of artificial origin, the conditions given in paras I.12(b) and I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] are required to be satisfied (see para. I.15 of GSR Part 3 [1]). The decision on clearance should therefore contain the following steps: (1) The summation rule in para. I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] (or in para. 3.5 of this Safety Guide) is applied to the radionuclides of artificial origin. (2) The clearance levels in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] are applied to each radionuclide of natural origin. (3) If both the radionuclides of artificial origin and the radionuclides of natural origin meet the clearance criteria, then the material can be cleared. If the radionuclides of artificial origin or the radionuclides of natural origin fail to meet the clearance criteria, then the material cannot be cleared. CHARACTERIZATION OF MATERIAL FOR CLEARANCE PURPOSES 3.9. The objective of radiological characterization of material to be cleared is to provide information on the radionuclides and their quantities, spatial distribution, physical states and chemical properties. The characterization results should be used by the operating organization to identify the material (or part thereof) to be cleared and to select the optimum monitoring programme for demonstration of compliance with the clearance levels. The characterization results should also be used to assess various options for the clearance of the material, for example (a) the use of batch monitoring tools and techniques; (b) the destinations for the cleared material; (c) the application of either generic clearance or specific clearance measures for the protection of workers, the public and the environment; and (d) economic factors.

The information on the history of the material to be cleared should be used to determine an initial estimate of the radionuclide composition of the material, and this initial estimate should be used to implement steps (2), (3) and (4) described in para. 3.10 (activation and decay calculation; sampling and analysis plan; and measurements, sampling and analysis). Initial measurements (e.g. dose rate, radiation type, surface contamination) should be performed to provide additional information to guide the preparation of the sampling plan (see paras 3.18–3.20). Sampling of material for clearance purposes 3.18. Steps (5) and (6) described in para. 3.10 (review and evaluation of the monitoring data, and comparison of calculated results and measured data) should be performed as early as possible and be used to provide feedback to the process of sampling and analysis. The characterization plans may change as a result of these ongoing assessments, for example where contamination is more (or less) extensive than originally anticipated or where trends in measurement results indicate that the original sampling plan will not provide the information necessary for clearance. The historical information may also need to be reviewed if additional radionuclides are identified in steps (2), (3) and (4) described in para. 3.10; consequently, the characterization process should be viewed as an iterative process. One of the important outputs from the characterization process is a credible radionuclide composition (or several possible compositions) for the material. 3.19. Two main types of measurement are relevant for the characterization of solid materials for clearance purposes: (a) measurements of surface contamination (fixed or removable) based on alpha, beta and/or gamma measurements and (b) bulk activity measurements, which are generally based on gamma spectrometry or total gamma measurements but can also include alpha and beta measurements (e.g. in cases where there is a uniform activity concentration). In each case, the methods of measurement should take into account the geometry, the surface conditions, and the nature, extent and distribution of the radioactive contaminants. It is unlikely that dose rate measurements alone will provide useful information for characterization for clearance, except in cases where a reliable relationship between dose rate and radionuclide composition has already been established.
