7,"by Rafael Mariano Grossi Director General The IAEA’s Statute authorizes it to “establish…standards of safety for protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property”. These are standards that the IAEA must apply to its own operations, and that States can apply through their national regulations. The IAEA started its safety standards programme in 1958 and there have been many developments since. As Director General, I am committed to ensuring that the IAEA maintains and improves upon this integrated, comprehensive and consistent set of up to date, user friendly and fit for purpose safety standards of high quality. Their proper application in the use of nuclear science and technology should offer a high level of protection for people and the environment across the world and provide the confidence necessary to allow for the ongoing use of nuclear technology for the benefit of all. Safety is a national responsibility underpinned by a number of international conventions. The IAEA safety standards form a basis for these legal instruments and serve as a global reference to help parties meet their obligations. While safety standards are not legally binding on Member States, they are widely applied. They have become an indispensable reference point and a common denominator for the vast majority of Member States that have adopted these standards for use in national regulations to enhance safety in nuclear power generation, research reactors and fuel cycle facilities as well as in nuclear applications in medicine, industry, agriculture and research. The IAEA safety standards are based on the practical experience of its Member States and produced through international consensus. The involvement of the members of the Safety Standards Committees, the Nuclear Security Guidance Committee and the Commission on Safety Standards is particularly important, and I am grateful to all those who contribute their knowledge and expertise to this endeavour. The IAEA also uses these safety standards when it assists Member States through its review missions and advisory services. This helps Member States in the application of the standards and enables valuable experience and insight to be shared. Feedback from these missions and services, and lessons identified from events and experience in the use and application of the safety standards, are taken into account during their periodic revision.","by Rafael Mariano Grossi Director General The IAEA’s Statute authorizes it to “establish…standards of safety for protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property”.

9,"THE IAEA SAFETY STANDARDS BACKGROUND Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon and natural sources of radiation are features of the environment. Radiation and radioactive substances have many beneficial applications, ranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry and agriculture. The radiation risks to workers and the public and to the environment that may arise from these applications have to be assessed and, if necessary, controlled. Activities such as the medical uses of radiation, the operation of nuclear installations, the production, transport and use of radioactive material, and the management of radioactive waste must therefore be subject to standards of safety. Regulating safety is a national responsibility. However, radiation risks may transcend national borders, and international cooperation serves to promote and enhance safety globally by exchanging experience and by improving capabilities to control hazards, to prevent accidents, to respond to emergencies and to mitigate any harmful consequences. States have an obligation of diligence and duty of care, and are expected to fulfil their national and international undertakings and obligations. International safety standards provide support for States in meeting their obligations under general principles of international law, such as those relating to environmental protection. International safety standards also promote and assure confidence in safety and facilitate international commerce and trade. A global nuclear safety regime is in place and is being continuously improved. IAEA safety standards, which support the implementation of binding international instruments and national safety infrastructures, are a cornerstone of this global regime. The IAEA safety standards constitute a useful tool for contracting parties to assess their performance under these international conventions. THE IAEA SAFETY STANDARDS The status of the IAEA safety standards derives from the IAEA’s Statute, which authorizes the IAEA to establish or adopt, in consultation and, where appropriate, in collaboration with the competent organs of the United Nations and with the specialized agencies concerned, standards of safety for protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property, and to provide for their application.","THE IAEA SAFETY STANDARDS BACKGROUND Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon and natural sources of radiation are features of the environment.

10,"With a view to ensuring the protection of people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation, the IAEA safety standards establish fundamental safety principles, requirements and measures to control the radiation exposure of people and the release of radioactive material to the environment, to restrict the likelihood of events that might lead to a loss of control over a nuclear reactor core, nuclear chain reaction, radioactive source or any other source of radiation, and to mitigate the consequences of such events if they were to occur. The standards apply to facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks, including nuclear installations, the use of radiation and radioactive sources, the transport of radioactive material and the management of radioactive waste. Safety measures and security measures1 have in common the aim of protecting human life and health and the environment. Safety measures and security measures must be designed and implemented in an integrated manner so that security measures do not compromise safety and safety measures do not compromise security. The IAEA safety standards reflect an international consensus on what constitutes a high level of safety for protecting people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation. They are issued in the IAEA Safety Standards Series, which has three categories (see Fig. 1). Safety Fundamentals Safety Fundamentals present the fundamental safety objective and principles of protection and safety, and provide the basis for the safety requirements. Safety Requirements An integrated and consistent set of Safety Requirements establishes the requirements that must be met to ensure the protection of people and the environment, both now and in the future. The requirements are governed by the objective and principles of the Safety Fundamentals. If the requirements are not met, measures must be taken to reach or restore the required level of safety. The format and style of the requirements facilitate their use for the establishment, in a harmonized manner, of a national regulatory framework. Requirements, including numbered ‘overarching’ requirements, are expressed as ‘shall’ statements. Many requirements are not addressed to a specific party, the implication being that the appropriate parties are responsible for fulfilling them.

The IAEA safety standards are also used by co‑sponsoring organizations and by many organizations that design, construct and operate nuclear facilities, as well as organizations involved in the use of radiation and radioactive sources. The IAEA safety standards are applicable, as relevant, throughout the entire lifetime of all facilities and activities — existing and new — utilized for peaceful purposes and to protective actions to reduce existing radiation risks. They can be Part 1. Governmental, Legal and Regulatory Framework for Safety Part 2. Leadership and Management for Safety Part 3. Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards Part 4. Safety Assessment for Facilities and Activities Part 5. Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste Part 6. Decommissioning of Facilities Part 7. Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency 1. Site Evaluation for Nuclear Installations 2/1. Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: Design 2/2. Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: Commissioning and Operation 3. Safety of Research Reactors 4.

The IAEA’s Statute makes the safety standards binding on the IAEA in relation to its own operations and also on States in relation to IAEA assisted operations. The IAEA safety standards also form the basis for the IAEA’s safety review services, and they are used by the IAEA in support of competence building, including the development of educational curricula and training courses. International conventions contain requirements similar to those in the IAEA safety standards and make them binding on contracting parties. The IAEA safety standards, supplemented by international conventions, industry standards and detailed national requirements, establish a consistent basis for protecting people and the environment. There will also be some special aspects of safety that need to be assessed at the national level. For example, many of the IAEA safety standards, in particular those addressing aspects of safety in planning or design, are intended to apply primarily to new facilities and activities. The requirements established in the IAEA safety standards might not be fully met at some existing facilities that were built to earlier standards. The way in which IAEA safety standards are to be applied to such facilities is a decision for individual States. The scientific considerations underlying the IAEA safety standards provide an objective basis for decisions concerning safety; however, decision makers must also make informed judgements and must determine how best to balance the benefits of an action or an activity against the associated radiation risks and any other detrimental impacts to which it gives rise. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR THE IAEA SAFETY STANDARDS The preparation and review of the safety standards involves the IAEA Secretariat and five Safety Standards Committees, for emergency preparedness and response (EPReSC) (as of 2016), nuclear safety (NUSSC), radiation safety (RASSC), the safety of radioactive waste (WASSC) and the safe transport of radioactive material (TRANSSC), and a Commission on Safety Standards (CSS) which oversees the IAEA safety standards programme (see Fig. 2). All IAEA Member States may nominate experts for the Safety Standards Committees and may provide comments on draft standards. The membership of the Commission on Safety Standards is appointed by the Director General and includes senior governmental officials having responsibility for establishing national standards. A management system has been established for the processes of planning, developing, reviewing, revising and establishing the IAEA safety standards.","used by States as a reference for their national regulations in respect of facilities and activities.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CLEARANCE 2.1. Clearance is defined as the removal of regulatory control, by the regulatory body, from radioactive material or radioactive objects within notified or authorized facilities and activities [9]. Removal of regulatory control in this context refers to regulatory control applied for radiation protection purposes. The two main options for clearance considered in this Safety Guide are the following: (a) Generic clearance: clearance on the basis of the clearance levels provided in schedule I of GSR Part 3 [1] or of any set of values defined in the national regulations of Member States that are intended for clearance without any restrictions on the material’s type, amount, further management, reuse, recycling or final destination. (b) Specific clearance: clearance on the basis of any other clearance levels derived for specific situations, materials and destinations of the cleared material. 2.2. Requirement 8 of GSR Part 3 [1] states that “The regulatory body shall approve which sources, including materials and objects, within notified practices or authorized practices may be cleared from regulatory control.” 2.3. In GSR Part 3 [1], the term ‘clearance’ is used in relation to sources, including materials and objects. The term is also used in relation to waste [10] and, within the context of decommissioning, to buildings or parts of buildings (e.g. rooms or laboratories within a building) [11]. The term is generally not used in the context of release of sites from regulatory control [6], where different criteria are usually applied. 2.4. Paragraph I.10 of schedule I of GSR Part 3 [1] states: “The general criteria for clearance are that: (a) Radiation risks arising from the cleared material are sufficiently low as not to warrant regulatory control, and there is no appreciable 6","waste to landfill.

In accordance with para. I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1], material may be cleared without further consideration (i.e. generic clearance) provided that in reasonably foreseeable circumstances the effective dose expected to be incurred by any individual is of the order of 10 μSv in a year. The value of 10 μSv in a year takes into account the possibility of exposure to multiple cleared objects [5]. 2.6. In addition to a dose criterion of the order of 10 μSv or less in a year, para. I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1] specifies that radioactive material may be cleared without further consideration (i.e. generic clearance) provided that the expected effective dose incurred by any individual from low probability scenarios does not exceed 1 mSv in a year. This concept of using two sets of scenarios (i.e. ‘realistic’ and ‘low probability’) is discussed further in Section 4. 2.7. Generic clearance levels in terms of activity concentration for solid material containing radionuclides of artificial origin are listed in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1]. They are based on the dose criteria provided in para. I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1] and were derived using generic models [5]. Clearance levels for material containing radionuclides of natural origin are listed in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1].

36,"As such, the values in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] for radionuclides of natural origin are not applicable, and the regulatory body will need to stipulate appropriate clearance values for construction materials. The approach to natural radioactivity in construction materials is considered in Refs [12, 13], and modelling of the drinking water exposure pathway for both drinking water and agriculture is addressed in Ref. [14]. 2.9. Where compliance with generic clearance levels is not reasonable, different clearance levels that still correspond to the dose criteria in para.

In such cases, specific clearance values could be included in the authorization issued by the regulatory body. More commonly, specific clearance levels may be proposed by the regulatory body for specific situations. In either case, the regulatory body may attach certain conditions to the cleared material or object and its further management. Further recommendations on specific clearance are provided in Section 7 of this Safety Guide. 2.10.

By means of this approval, the regulatory body shall ensure that sources that have been cleared from regulatory control do not again become subject to the requirements for notification, registration or licensing unless it so specifies.” Consequently, the provisions for clearance should be embedded into the regulatory framework, which should clearly specify that cleared materials are 8","As such, the values in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] for radionuclides of natural origin are not applicable, and the regulatory body will need to stipulate appropriate clearance values for construction materials.

Figure 2 illustrates the different options for clearance of material containing radionuclides of artificial origin, as described in GSR Part 3 [1]. 2.12. Material from remediation activities or from post‑emergency situations is required to be managed using a protection strategy based on reference levels for existing exposure situations, in accordance with section 5 of GSR Part 3 [1] (see also IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSG‑15, Remediation Strategy and Process for Areas Affected by Past Activities or Events [15]). The concept of clearance can also be applied to the management of material originating from remediation activities or from post‑emergency situations.

For example, it is not feasible to control exposure from 40K in the human body or from cosmic radiation at the surface of the Earth (see footnote 8 of GSR Part 3 [1]). Other examples of excluded exposures include those from unmodified concentrations of radionuclides of natural origin in normal soil material, including those in high natural background radiation areas. Also excluded are exposures from unmodified concentrations of other primordial radionuclides (e.g. 87Rb, 138La, 147Sm, 176Lu) and fallout resulting from past atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. The concept of exclusion is addressed in more detail in GSG‑17 [4]. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE REGULATORY BODY IN RELATION TO CLEARANCE 2.14. To meet Requirement 8 of GSR Part 3 [1], the regulatory body should establish a framework for the clearance of material, including the clearance levels to be used (which should be in agreement with the clearance criteria defined in schedule I of GSR Part 3 [1]). As part of this framework, the regulatory body should establish requirements for the radiological characterization of materials and objects and should review and validate the results of the characterization programme implemented by operating organizations (see paras 3.9–3.24). 2.15. For the generic clearance of solid material, the regulatory body should refer to the derived clearance levels for radionuclides of artificial origin and for radionuclides of natural origin listed in table I.2 and table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1], respectively. These values are applicable to clearance of moderate quantities of material (i.e. of the order of a tonne, at the most) as well as bulk quantities [5]. 2.16. For clearance of surface contaminated objects, the regulatory body should enable the use of surface contamination clearance levels, derived using the same criteria as for activity concentration clearance levels. Further recommendations are provided in paras 4.17–4.22 and 7.15–7.22. 2.17. When establishing clearance levels, the regulatory body should take into account other regulatory requirements that might apply, such as those in relation to non‑radiation‑related hazards (e.g. chemical toxicity), and, to the extent possible, should harmonize these requirements. 2.18.

In such cases, the regulatory body and the operating organization should explain the implications of the derived clearance levels to relevant interested parties (see Section 8). If conditions are specified for the type and amount of material to be cleared or for the material’s destination, then these conditions should also be explained. 2.19. In addition to defining or approving clearance levels in terms of activity concentration or surface contamination, the regulatory body should specify averaging masses, volumes or areas of material to be monitored for clearance. When approving specific clearance levels proposed by an operating organization, the regulatory body should specify other relevant parameters, such as those relating to the characteristics of the material or its geometry. The regulatory body should also specify additional monitoring criteria to identify non‑uniform distribution of activity and how to interpret the results for clearance purposes. Further recommendations are provided in paras 4.23–4.37. 2.20. The regulatory body should specify that deliberate dilution and/or mixing with non‑radioactive material to meet clearance levels prior to release of the material from regulatory control is generally not an acceptable practice.

If this involves the use of statistically based methods (i.e. decision making on the basis of measurement of samples, where the measurement results are evaluated on the basis of statistical analysis) by the operating organization, the approach should be fully documented, defining the number and locations of samples and the statistical parameters to be met, and should be approved by the regulatory body prior to its implementation. 2.23. The quality management system implemented by the operating organization for clearance purposes should satisfy the requirements established by the regulatory body. 2.24. For specific clearance, the regulatory body should establish a mechanism to verify compliance with any conditions attached, such as on the destination for materials or objects and on their further processing or reuse (e.g. that metals will only go to a recycling facility and will be melted rather than reused directly). In addition, the regulatory body should clarify the responsibilities for the clearance process and the consequences of non‑compliance. 2.25. Paragraph 2.35 of GSR Part 3 [1] states that “The regulatory body shall make provision for establishing, maintaining and retrieving adequate records relating to facilities and activities.” For the clearance of material, the regulatory body should define the content of key records and documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the regulatory body should define the period of time that such records and documentation need to be kept (i.e. depending on the history, nature and characteristics of the material) after materials have been cleared. 2.26. Materials or objects that have been cleared could still be subject to regulatory controls for non‑radiation‑related purposes (see para. 2.17). Therefore, the regulatory body should coordinate its activities with other relevant regulatory authorities to facilitate management of the material after clearance. In the case of transboundary movement, this coordination should involve regulatory bodies from the relevant countries. 2.27. The regulatory body should establish requirements relating to the education and training of persons who have responsibilities for clearance, including qualified experts, radiation protection officers, workers and staff of the regulatory body. 12","suitable for clearance, the approval should be based on these monitoring results and the regulatory body’s own verification programme.

The quality management system implemented by the operating organization for clearance purposes should satisfy the requirements established by the regulatory body. 2.24.	For specific clearance, the regulatory body should establish a mechanism to verify compliance with any conditions attached, such as on the destination for materials or objects and on their further processing or reuse (e.g. that metals will only go to a recycling facility and will be melted rather than reused directly). In addition, the regulatory body should clarify the responsibilities for the clearance process and the consequences of non‑compliance. 2.25.	Paragraph 2.35 of GSR Part 3 [1] states that “The regulatory body shall make provision for establishing, maintaining and retrieving adequate records relating to facilities and activities.” For the clearance of material, the regulatory body should define the content of key records and documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the regulatory body should define the period of time that such records and documentation need to be kept (i.e. depending on the history, nature and characteristics of the material) after materials have been cleared. 2.26.	Materials or objects that have been cleared could still be subject to regulatory controls for non‑radiation‑related purposes (see para. 2.17). Therefore, the regulatory body should coordinate its activities with other relevant regulatory authorities to facilitate management of the material after clearance. In the case of transboundary movement, this coordination should involve regulatory bodies from the relevant countries. 2.27.

The clearance process should consider the requirements of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR‑6 (Rev. 1), Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, 2018 Edition [16]. Table 2 of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16] specifies activity concentration limits for exempt material, which are higher than the generic clearance levels specified in tables I.2 and I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1]. Thus, any material that has been cleared on the basis of these generic activity concentration clearance levels will be exempt from the requirements of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16]. CONSIDERATION OF CLEARANCE FOR MATERIALS CONTAINING MORE THAN ONE RADIONUCLIDE 3.3. As part of the clearance process, the radionuclide composition of the material should be determined through a process of characterization. The result should be a list of the radionuclides present and their contribution to the total activity concentration or surface contamination level. The different processes that have contributed to the presence of radionuclides in the waste (e.g. nuclear fission, activation by particles, contamination) should also be identified. 3.4.

Instead, the activity concentration of each radionuclide of natural origin should be compared with the clearance levels in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1], and if each one is less than or equal to the clearance level then the material can be cleared. For example, for a material containing radionuclides from the 238U decay chain, the clearance level of 1 Bq/g would apply to each radionuclide present. Where the secular equilibrium is significantly disturbed (e.g. owing to thermal processes) or only parts of the decay chain are present, use of the clearance levels given in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] might be too restrictive. In such cases, the regulatory body or operating organization might derive more appropriate values (i.e. specific clearance). 3.8. For clearance of solid bulk material containing a mixture of radionuclides of natural origin and radionuclides of artificial origin, the conditions given in paras I.12(b) and I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] are required to be satisfied (see para. I.15 of GSR Part 3 [1]). The decision on clearance should therefore contain the following steps: (1) The summation rule in para. I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] (or in para. 3.5 of this Safety Guide) is applied to the radionuclides of artificial origin. (2) The clearance levels in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] are applied to each radionuclide of natural origin. (3) If both the radionuclides of artificial origin and the radionuclides of natural origin meet the clearance criteria, then the material can be cleared. If the radionuclides of artificial origin or the radionuclides of natural origin fail to meet the clearance criteria, then the material cannot be cleared. CHARACTERIZATION OF MATERIAL FOR CLEARANCE PURPOSES 3.9. The objective of radiological characterization of material to be cleared is to provide information on the radionuclides and their quantities, spatial distribution, physical states and chemical properties. The characterization results should be used by the operating organization to identify the material (or part thereof) to be cleared and to select the optimum monitoring programme for demonstration of compliance with the clearance levels. The characterization results should also be used to assess various options for the clearance of the material, for example (a) the use of batch monitoring tools and techniques; (b) the destinations for the cleared material; (c) the application of either generic clearance or specific clearance measures for the protection of workers, the public and the environment; and (d) economic factors. The level of detail and the implementation of the proposed 19","in para.  I.14 of GSR  Part  3 [1] is not appropriate for clearance of materials containing radionuclides of natural origin.

The decision on clearance should therefore contain the following steps: (1) The summation rule in para. I.14 of GSR Part 3 [1] (or in para. 3.5 of this Safety Guide) is applied to the radionuclides of artificial origin. (2) The clearance levels in table I.3 of GSR  Part  3 [1] are applied to each radionuclide of natural origin. (3) If both the radionuclides of artificial origin and the radionuclides of natural origin meet the clearance criteria, then the material can be cleared. If the radionuclides of artificial origin or the radionuclides of natural origin fail to meet the clearance criteria, then the material cannot be cleared. CHARACTERIZATION OF MATERIAL FOR CLEARANCE PURPOSES 3.9.	 The objective of radiological characterization of material to be cleared is to provide information on the radionuclides and their quantities, spatial distribution, physical states and chemical properties. The characterization results should be used by the operating organization to identify the material (or part thereof) to be cleared and to select the optimum monitoring programme for demonstration of compliance with the clearance levels. The characterization results should also be used to assess various options for the clearance of the material, for example (a) the use of batch monitoring tools and techniques; (b) the destinations for the cleared material; (c)  the application of either generic clearance or specific clearance measures for the protection of workers, the public and the environment; and (d) economic factors.

As indicated in para. 3.9, a graded approach should be applied to the characterization of material for clearance purposes. For complex situations, the characterization process could involve collecting information on the following: (a) The location and type of the originating facility or activity, the operational history (including incidents and post‑incident remediation), the origin of the material within the facility or activity, and the radionuclides associated with operations (see also paras 3.14–3.17); (b) The size, type and quantities (total and rate of production) of material; (c) The radionuclides present in the material and the expected levels of contamination or activation; (d) The nature of the contamination (i.e. fixed or non‑fixed surface contamination, or bulk contamination); (e) The distribution of contamination (including identification of hotspots on the surface or within the volume); (f) Other hazards associated with the material; (g) The time frame for the clearance process and the necessary clearance monitoring throughput.

Material for clearance may contain more than one radionuclide, and some of these radionuclides may be difficult to measure routinely during the clearance process. The information obtained from the historical review and the calculations can be used to determine an initial estimate of the radionuclides expected to be present and the ratios (also called scaling factors4) between the different radionuclides [23, 24]. Then, a limited number of detailed measurements can be used to determine whether difficult to measure radionuclides occur in a consistent ratio with easy to measure radionuclides. If this is the case, scaling factors can be used to estimate the activity of difficult to measure radionuclides based on the measurements of the easy to measure radionuclides. An example is the use of measured 60Co activity to assess and monitor a wide range of difficult to measure radionuclides present in activated materials or in corrosion products associated with the operation of nuclear reactors. 3.22. Scaling factors for difficult to measure radionuclides should be used with caution and reviewed at an appropriate frequency. In some facilities, one set of scaling factors can be applicable over a large area, whereas in other facilities the radionuclide composition may vary considerably over space and time, and for different materials, particularly where chemical processes or decontamination procedures have taken place. Therefore, scaling factors should be based on information such as that described in para. 3.21, rather than applying values already determined (i.e. from other clearance batches or from the evaluation of low level radioactive waste). Radionuclide composition will also vary in cases where the radioactivity is generated by neutron activation of impurities in the material and the concentration of such impurities varies significantly (e.g. variations in the content of cobalt in steel). 3.23.

If the surface contamination clearance levels are complied with, the material can be moved to the next station; if not, additional decontamination may be necessary, and the material is sent to a dedicated area for further treatment or for management as radioactive waste. In some cases, the results of the surface contamination measurement may be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with activity concentration clearance levels (in which case, steps (5) and (6) can be omitted). (5) Following demonstration of compliance with the surface contamination clearance levels (if this step is included), the material is moved to the next buffer storage area, awaiting measurements for determination of the activity concentrations. (6) The bulk activity is determined. In cases where the percentage of gamma emitting radionuclides is sufficiently high, bulk monitors based on gross gamma counting or drum monitors based on gamma spectrometric measurements can be used for this step. In other cases, the bulk activity is determined from the analysis of samples, from surface measurements or from other measurement methods.

In such cases, the material is brought to a further buffer storage area outside or at the border of the controlled area or supervised area, where these verification measurements are performed. If compliance with clearance levels is verified, the material is cleared. Otherwise, the material stays under regulatory control and other waste management options are considered.

Practical experience from decommissioning projects involving clearance of large amounts of material has shown that the following considerations are beneficial for effective implementation of the clearance process: (a) Moving the material in suitable containers such as boxes (e.g. 1 m3) or drums (e.g. 200 L), instead of as single items, ensures that material of similar origin is kept together, that the material can be traced easily via the identifier of the box and that the bulk measurements can be performed directly on these containers. (b) Providing buffer storage areas of sufficient size between the various steps of the clearance process enables the flow of materials to be maintained even if there are delays (e.g. due to temporary unavailability of a monitoring instrument) during one of the steps.

If a facility is too small to provide adequate space for the clearance process and if no area with sufficiently low background radiation is available, it might be better to construct an appropriately designed separate facility where the process can be implemented. The levels of radioactivity in material undergoing the clearance process are expected to be of a similar order to the clearance levels (this should be ensured by an adequate characterization performed prior to this step). Consequently, the clearance of material should pose a low radiological risk, even if some of the material does not actually comply with the clearance levels. Such separate facilities may be of simple design without extensive provisions for shielding or ventilation. The use of a separate facility for clearance can also contribute to reducing non‑radiation‑related risks by separating activities relating to clearance from the facility where other activities are performed. 4.

62,"ACTIVITY CONCENTRATION CRITERIA FOR GENERIC CLEARANCE 4.3. The activity concentration clearance levels specified in tables I.2 and I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] apply to solid materials, for example contaminated or activated structures and components, or contaminated soils. 4.4. The methodology used to calculate the clearance levels for artificial radionuclides in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] is described in Ref. [5]. For each radionuclide of artificial origin, the activity concentration clearance level was determined on the basis of a set of exposure scenarios, each of which considered external irradiation, dust inhalation and ingestion (direct and indirect, including ingestion of radionuclides via drinking water and water for agricultural purposes). The clearance levels listed in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] are the lower of the values obtained from the following approaches: (a) The use of ‘realistic’ scenarios, applying an effective dose criterion of 10 µSv in a year; (b) The use of ‘low probability’ scenarios, applying an effective dose criterion of 1 mSv in a year and a skin equivalent dose limit of 50 mSv in a year. The clearance levels derived from the calculations were then rounded to the nearest power of ten using a near logarithmic rounding approach [5]; the models and assumptions used do not justify higher precision. Consequently, demonstrating that the resulting dose will be of the order of 10 μSv in a year or less should be commensurate with this level of precision (i.e. with the logarithmically rounded values of the clearance level). 4.5. The clearance levels for artificial radionuclides in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] are applicable for materials that may be incinerated, since scenarios relevant to incineration were taken into account when deriving these clearance levels [5]. The clearance levels specified in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] also consider possible processes that could lead to increase of concentrations of radionuclides in the material. 4.6. The clearance levels for artificial radionuclides in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] are not applicable to foodstuffs, drinking water, animal feed or any material intended for use in food or animal feed. In addition, in some cases, these clearance levels might not be appropriate for very large quantities of material. For example, in the case of excavated soil, the model used in Ref.

Activity concentration clearance levels are specified in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] for over 250 radionuclides of artificial origin. Values for other radionuclides of artificial origin should be derived using the models for radionuclides of artificial origin described in Ref. [5]. Examples of values for other radionuclides can also be found in national regulations, for example Refs [25, 26]. 4.8. A scenario based approach was not used in the case of material that contains radionuclides of natural origin. Instead, the activity concentration clearance levels specified in table I.3 of GSR Part 3 [1] were established using a pragmatic approach that involved consideration of the worldwide distribution of the concentration of radionuclides of natural origin present in material found in the environment. The values are applicable to all radionuclides of natural origin in the 238U decay chain and the 232Th decay chain and for 40K. The same pragmatic approach should be used to determine the activity concentration clearance levels for other primordial radionuclides (e.g. 87Rb, 138La, 147Sm, 176Lu) in situations where these radionuclides are of interest for clearance. 4.9. The methodology in Ref. [5] focuses on the handling (i.e. transport, trade, use and disposal) of material outside the facilities in which it arises (e.g. nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, research laboratories). The scenarios used to derive clearance levels for radionuclides of artificial origin consider a decay time before the start of the exposure, which is assumed to be at least one day (or considerably longer for some scenarios). Therefore, the methodology used in Ref. [5] is not suitable for calculating activity concentration clearance levels for very short lived radionuclides (i.e. with half‑lives of a few hours or less), unless scenarios without a significant decay time prior to start of the exposure are added. An alternative approach is described in para. 4.11. If direct handling could be avoided or decay storage for several days or weeks is provided before clearance of materials containing very short lived radionuclides, that may eliminate the need for such considerations. 4.10. When direct handling of moderate quantities of material after clearance is considered without significant decay, the exemption levels given in table I.1 of GSR Part 3 [1] are also applicable for clearance, since no decay or waiting time was assumed when deriving these exemption levels, and the same dose criteria were applied for both exemption and clearance [1]. 30","large quantities.

Many individual parameter values were chosen conservatively, for example the following: (a) In many ‘low probability’ scenarios, completely bounding values were assumed for the following: (i) Exposure times (8760 hours for the full year, 1800 hours for the full working year); (ii) Dilution (a factor of 1 (i.e. no dilution)); (iii) Decay time prior to and during the scenario (one day and no days, respectively, corresponding to virtually no decay at all); (iv) Unfavourable exposure conditions (as for the water pathway considerations in Ref. [5]). (b) The groundwater model contains a number of conservative assumptions, such as the following: (i) The whole inventory of radionuclides in the material is available for migration.

65,"(c) With regard to exposure from skin contamination, the dose coefficients were based on a skin surface weight of 4 mg/cm2. In practice, contamination would predominantly occur on the hands, where the skin surface weight is significantly higher. 4.13. Methods have been applied to limit the overall degree of conservatism, as follows: (a) Two sets of scenarios were used in parallel, one applying ‘realistic’ scenarios for an individual effective dose criterion of the order of 10 µSv in a year, and one applying ‘low probability’ scenarios for an individual effective dose criterion of 1 mSv in a year. In this way, parameter values for the ‘realistic’ scenarios could be less conservative. This approach meets the criteria for clearance in paras I.10 and I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1]. (b) The scenarios for workers and members of the public were formulated in such a way that exposure pathways that could occur simultaneously (e.g. external irradiation and inhalation) were analysed together and their dose contributions added. This allowed the necessary conservatism in the model to be applied over the sum of exposure pathways rather than applying it to each pathway individually, thus reducing the overall amount of conservatism in the model. 4.14. Notwithstanding the methods described in para. 4.13, there are other reasons why clearance levels are conservative, as follows: (a) The application of the summation rule for cases where there is more than one radionuclide present is inherently a conservative approach since the exposure pathways for the representative person are not necessarily the same for each radionuclide, for example because of partitioning or separation of radionuclides by processes. A less conservative approach would be to sum the contributions of the radionuclides in the radionuclide mixture for each scenario and each exposure pathway first and then derive the activity concentration value. (b) The dose contribution from progeny radionuclides is always included together with the parent radionuclide with a percentage that corresponds to the highest ingrowth within a time span of 100 years after clearance. This leads to a slight overestimation of the dose coefficient for the mixture of parent and progeny radionuclides. 4.15.

Their implementation in practice could take into account this model‑intrinsic conservatism to avoid the imposition of further conservatisms commensurate with the degree of conservatism in the model. The particular case and the requirements of the national regulatory framework should also be considered. 4.16. That clearance levels have been derived conservatively should be considered in the implementation of the clearance process, for example by using larger averaging areas or averaging masses. SURFACE CONTAMINATION CLEARANCE LEVELS 4.17. For surface contaminated items where the radioactivity is concentrated on surfaces, compliance with activity concentration clearance levels (Bq/g) might not be sufficient in all cases because there are additional considerations relating to the handling of the material. In such cases, surface contamination clearance levels could be specified, either for generic clearance (which may be specified by the regulatory body in accordance with para. 3.12 of GSR Part 3 [1]) or for specific clearance (which may be granted by the regulatory body in accordance with para. I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1]). 4.18. Surface contamination clearance levels could be derived by the operating organization and reviewed and approved by the regulatory body. Alternatively, surface contamination clearance levels could be specified by the regulatory body as part of the regulatory framework for clearance. The operating organization should then comply with these surface contamination clearance levels, in addition to complying with the generic activity concentration clearance levels5. 4.19. Surface contamination clearance levels are intended to limit the contamination that is directly accessible and could be mobilized during handling of the material. They also limit direct exposure by external irradiation from handling surface contaminated items. The radioactivity inside and on the surface of the cleared material has to be appropriately limited to guarantee compliance with the dose criterion of the order of 10 µSv in a year stated in para. I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1]. An example of the application of surface contamination and activity concentration clearance levels is given in Table 1 [27]. 5 In some cases, compliance with activity concentration clearance levels can be inferred from measurements of surface activity (see para. 4.44). 33","that the clearance levels have been derived on a sufficiently conservative basis while avoiding being overly conservative [5].

In such cases, surface contamination clearance levels could be specified, either for generic clearance (which may be specified by the regulatory body in accordance with para. 3.12 of GSR Part 3 [1]) or for specific clearance (which may be granted by the regulatory body in accordance with para. I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1]). 4.18.	Surface contamination clearance levels could be derived by the operating organization and reviewed and approved by the regulatory body. Alternatively, surface contamination clearance levels could be specified by the regulatory body as part of the regulatory framework for clearance. The operating organization should then comply with these surface contamination clearance levels, in addition to complying with the generic activity concentration clearance levels5. 4.19.	Surface contamination clearance levels are intended to limit the contamination that is directly accessible and could be mobilized during handling of the material. They also limit direct exposure by external irradiation from handling surface contaminated items. The radioactivity inside and on the surface of the cleared material has to be appropriately limited to guarantee compliance with the dose criterion of the order of 10 µSv in a year stated in para. I.11 of GSR  Part  3 [1]. An example of the application of surface contamination and activity concentration clearance levels is given in Table 1 [27]. 5	 In some cases, compliance with activity concentration clearance levels can be inferred from measurements of surface activity (see para. 4.44). 33",51,file:///private/var/folders/1y/lclhr1bn1_b78zjjhqs572mc0000gn/T/gradio/200a7b0092a9b8794864bb354529c4757d299729811eaa5dfc1d84ab62525afa/PUB2058_web_gsg_18.pdf#page=51,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

In general, the derivation of these surface contamination clearance levels considers both the fixed and removable activity on the surface of items. 4.21. The values of surface contamination clearance levels for certain radionuclides, as derived by different international studies and recommendations, can differ. The differences are due to different assumptions in the models used to derive the clearance levels (e.g. in relation to the material, the size of an item, geometry, or exposure scenarios). Therefore, application of a set of surface contamination clearance levels (derived for a specific situation) to a different situation should be done with care, taking into account the adequacy of any assumptions, the characteristics of the material or items, and the exposure scenarios used. 4.22. If surface contamination clearance levels have not been specified, items with surface contamination might instead be considered in terms of their compliance with activity concentration clearance levels. This can be achieved by converting the total activity on the surface to an activity concentration (Bq/g), taking account of the total mass of the material below the surface (i.e. the activity concentration should not be calculated by just using the thickness of the layer of surface contamination). In doing this, considerations relating to the models used to derive the clearance levels need also be taken into account, particularly the averaging mass (see paras 4.23–4.37). For example, if a metal sheet with a thickness of 0.8 cm and a density of 7.8 g/cm3 has a surface contamination level of 0.4 Bq/cm2 of 60Co on one side, the average activity concentration is calculated as 0.064 Bq/g. The relevant clearance level (as specified in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1]) is 0.1 Bq/g.

The regulatory body should determine or approve appropriate averaging masses to be used in the clearance process, in particular for compliance measurements; the averaging procedures used by the operating organization should take these averaging masses into account. Examples of appropriate averaging masses are from a few hundred kilograms to the order of a tonne. The regulatory body should confirm that the averaging procedure is not used solely to allow material that contains radioactivity above the clearance levels to be cleared. The operating organization should ensure that averaging procedures, selected in accordance with the type of material, are an integral part of the clearance process. For small objects with a mass less than the specified averaging mass, a minimum default averaging mass (e.g. 1 kg) could be defined by the regulatory body, which in turn allows the specification of a maximum total activity for these objects for a specified radionuclide (e.g. 100 Bq for 60Co) or radionuclide composition. It should be ensured that this does not result in large objects being divided into smaller ones solely as a means of achieving clearance. In the case of several small objects, an alternative method would be to monitor them together to replicate the averaging mass. 4.25. In the case of surface contamination clearance levels, the regulatory body should consider, depending on the type of material, and the nature and homogeneity of the contamination, averaging areas from several hundred square centimetres up to 1 m2. In some cases, averaging areas for specific clearance could be higher, for example up to 10 m2 for the clearance of buildings for demolition. 4.26. For non‑accessible surfaces that might be expected to be contaminated to some degree, the operating organization should make a conservative assessment of the surface activity for comparison with the clearance levels. Similarly to the clearance of small and light objects on the basis of activity concentration clearance levels, the regulatory body could define a default minimum averaging surface area (e.g. 100 cm2) for objects with surfaces below the default averaging area. If there are several of these small objects, an alternative method would be to combine measurements of the surfaces of individual objects to compare against clearance levels that are to be applied to a larger average surface area. 4.27.

In deciding on a measurement strategy, the operating organization should batch the material so that it is as homogeneous as possible in relation to both material and origin, and thus in relation to the radionuclide composition and activity level. Variations in the results of individual measurements within one averaging mass or area should be expected. For example, variations in individual results of up to a factor of ten (compared with the average value) are generally considered acceptable, whereas a greater variation would be acceptable if the overall average concentration or surface contamination level was a very small fraction of the clearance level. 4.29. The operating organization should make use of the maximum permitted averaging areas or masses when designing the monitoring programme for clearance, as this improves the efficiency of the clearance process. The monitoring programme may be constrained by the form and nature of the contamination; for example, the choice of equipment available for monitoring for beta activity inside a small pipe is likely to be limited. Nevertheless, using appropriate time integration in dynamic measurements (e.g. recording counts over a minute, rather than over a second) or numerically averaging over a number of single static measurements will enable a greater averaging area to be achieved. 4.30. Measurements to determine whether a material or object is in compliance with clearance levels will be based on a measurement unit defined by the monitoring method and the instrumentation used (e.g. contamination monitor, drum monitor, bulk monitor).

Parts of the materials or surfaces with activity concentrations significantly higher than the clearance levels (i.e. hotspots) that were identified during characterization should be considered for removal (decontamination) prior to dismantling or demolition of structures or components.

In cases where compliance with surface contamination clearance levels is demonstrated using instruments with a much smaller detector surface area than the averaging area, information on homogeneity, and hence the presence of hotspots, can be derived from the variation in individual measurement results.

Many processes involving bulk measurement are based on scanning or multipoint measurements, both of which can be set up to identify elevated levels of activity. Another approach to demonstrating compliance with hotspot criteria [31] is to use measurement techniques sensitive enough to detect the ‘worst case’ activity levels. For example, if measurements are taken on the outside of a drum, calculations to demonstrate compliance could assume that all the contamination is located in the centre of the drum (surrounded by clean material), that is, furthest from the detectors and shielded by the clean contents. This will result in increased measurement resources (e.g. longer counting times, more measurements, more sensitive detectors), but the additional cost may be small compared with undertaking additional monitoring to demonstrate compliance with criteria for both the average mass and hotspots within the volume of the material. This approach works well for a drum where the density is low and the radionuclides emit high energy gamma radiation (e.g. 60Co in concrete rubble) and where the activity concentration is well below the clearance level. This approach is not suitable if the material itself provides significant shielding and the gamma energy is lower (e.g. metal contaminated with 241Am) and the activity concentration is close to the clearance level. 39","of up to ten times are tolerated.

Within the monitoring programme, a distinction should be made between the monitoring strategy and the monitoring technique. The monitoring strategy relates to the batch process itself, whereas the monitoring technique (i.e. surface measurement, bulk measurement or sample analysis) is the tool within the monitoring strategy to facilitate decision making on clearance of a batch. The monitoring strategy should take into account the input material in the batch process and the output options (i.e. whether the material is cleared or is selected for other waste management options). The optimal strategy should be based on occupational exposure, public exposure, protection of the environment and economic factors. 4.41. The monitoring strategy should determine which monitoring techniques are the most appropriate for a given batch. Depending on the material being considered, a combination of techniques can be used. 4.42. The choice of monitoring technique involves the selection of radiation measurement equipment. The response of the equipment will depend on the radiation type and energy and on the detector–source geometry. A good knowledge of the radionuclides to be measured should be obtained prior to establishment of the monitoring programme. Where appropriate, key radionuclides should be defined in the radionuclide mixture and the contribution of other radionuclides can be assessed by the use of scaling factors, as described in paras 3.21 and 3.22.

Within the monitoring programme, a distinction should be made between the monitoring strategy and the monitoring technique. The monitoring strategy relates to the batch process itself, whereas the monitoring technique (i.e. surface measurement, bulk measurement or sample analysis) is the tool within the monitoring strategy to facilitate decision making on clearance of a batch. The monitoring strategy should take into account the input material in the batch process and the output options (i.e. whether the material is cleared or is selected for other waste management options). The optimal strategy should be based on occupational exposure, public exposure, protection of the environment and economic factors. 4.41.	The monitoring strategy should determine which monitoring techniques are the most appropriate for a given batch. Depending on the material being considered, a combination of techniques can be used. 4.42.	The choice of monitoring technique involves the selection of radiation measurement equipment. The response of the equipment will depend on the radiation type and energy and on the detector–source geometry. A good knowledge of the radionuclides to be measured should be obtained prior to establishment of the monitoring programme. Where appropriate, key radionuclides should be defined in the radionuclide mixture and the contribution of other radionuclides can be assessed by the use of scaling factors, as described in paras 3.21 and 3.22. On the basis of this information, an appropriate radiation measurement instrument should be selected for clearance monitoring, taking into account the value of the clearance level (in terms of activity concentration or surface contamination 40",58,file:///private/var/folders/1y/lclhr1bn1_b78zjjhqs572mc0000gn/T/gradio/200a7b0092a9b8794864bb354529c4757d299729811eaa5dfc1d84ab62525afa/PUB2058_web_gsg_18.pdf#page=58,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

The personnel responsible for the selection of monitoring techniques and the associated equipment should have suitable qualifications, experience and knowledge. 4.43. The response of the measurement equipment, expressed in operational units (e.g. counts integrated over a period of time), should be converted into the same quantities as the clearance levels under consideration (i.e. Bq/g or Bq/cm2). Surface contamination measurements for clearance 4.44. If the radioactivity is limited to the surface, for example in the case of impermeable objects, surface contamination measurements could be performed as a means of demonstrating compliance with activity concentration clearance levels. For example, instead of performing activity concentration measurements directly, it might be possible to convert the results of surface measurements to activity concentrations and hence prove compliance also with activity concentration clearance levels. For this, the ratio between mass and surface area needs to be taken into account, for example by considering the thickness and density of the objects and the number of contaminated surfaces [31]. Alternatively, it may be possible to derive surface contamination clearance levels from activity concentration clearance levels. Conversely, if the material is permeable, then the contamination will penetrate some distance into the material, and in this case both surface and volumetric measurements may be needed to demonstrate compliance with clearance levels. 4.45. For the assessment of surface contamination, the principles and methods described in international standards (e.g. Ref. [32]) should be used for direct and indirect measurements and for the calibration of the associated instrumentation. If the use of surface contamination monitors in a ratemeter mode is not sufficiently reliable, reproducible or auditable for clearance purposes, then measurements based on integrated counts over a defined time should be used. Measurement techniques for clearance 4.46. When undertaking direct measurements of surface contamination, attention should be given to the condition of the surface to be measured. The ideal surface is clean, dry and flat. Dust, grease, rust and moisture on a surface can absorb beta and (especially) alpha radiation.

An uneven surface will affect direct measurements of surface contamination owing to difficulties in ensuring the correct distance between the surface and the detector, which will affect the detector response. 4.48. For total gamma measurements, it may be possible to calibrate the monitoring instruments for a single radionuclide and derive the calibration factors for other radionuclides through calculations or on the basis of scaling factors (see paras 3.21 and 3.22) as determined from the radionuclide composition. 4.49. For in situ gamma spectrometry, the response to individual radionuclides depends on their distribution (i.e. on the surface and/or in the volume).

Software for calibration is also provided by manufacturers of gamma spectrometry equipment. 4.50. Samples may be taken using wipe tests for removable surface contamination or by collecting a small fraction of the material itself. Wipe tests should be analysed using a surface contamination monitor or be subject to sample preparation and measurements in a laboratory (e.g. for tritium measurements). Only removable surface contamination can be quantified through wipe samples, and additional measurements may be needed to determine the fixed contamination. Samples of material should be analysed in laboratories with the necessary equipment. The laboratories should have a quality assurance system and should be accredited in accordance with national requirements or international standards (e.g. Ref. [34]). 4.51. When sampling is part of the clearance process, additional issues — such as sampling position, minimum sample size and number of samples — should be addressed. If the spatial distribution of the contamination is unknown or assumed to be uniform, a sample grid should be used, where the distance between two grid points is determined by the total area sampled and the number of samples needed. The position of the individual samples should be recorded. The sample measurements should provide information on the activity distribution in the material or object as a whole, to be compared with the clearance levels. 4.52.

According to these references, the number of samples should be increased if the results of the statistical test are not satisfactory with respect to median value and standard deviation. 4.53. An instrument used for monitoring a material for compliance with the clearance level for a specific radionuclide (or mixture of radionuclides) has to have a limit of detection sufficiently below the clearance level. The limit of detection should be determined in accordance with international standards (e.g. Ref. [35]). The limit of detection depends on the measurement technique; the measurement conditions, such as background and measurement time; and the accepted level of confidence in the measurement. In the case of sampling, the minimum sample size should be chosen to ensure that the limit of detection is well below the clearance level. Possible loss of material in the sample preparation process should be taken into account when calculating the minimum sample size. 4.54. When applying the concept of clearance, the background activity in the material (i.e. that existed prior to its contamination or activation during a practice) should be subtracted from the measured total activity. Activity from sources other than those in the practice itself, for example naturally occurring radionuclides (i.e. from the 238U and 232Th decay chains, and 40K) in building material or fallout from nuclear weapon tests and nuclear accidents, should be subtracted from the results of clearance measurements. Similarly, cosmic radiation and naturally occurring levels of other primordial radionuclides should also be subtracted from the results. 4.55.

78,"CONSIDERATION OF UNCERTAINTIES IN CLEARANCE MEASUREMENTS 4.57. The clearance process, in particular the measurement programme, involves a number of uncertainties that need to be taken into account to ensure that the final result used for making a decision about clearance is reliable.

The uncertainties to be considered involve two main types: statistical uncertainties associated with the counting process, and uncertainties relating to the measurement process that can be evaluated by means other than statistical analysis (e.g. based on experience or other information). The uncertainties that are most relevant for the clearance process are as follows: (a) Statistical uncertainties associated with the counting process; (b) State of the surface of the measured material; (c) Fluctuation of the geometry and the self‑shielding of the measured material; (d) Fluctuation of the activity distribution in the measured material; (e) Fluctuation of the background; (f) Fluctuation of the contributions of individual radionuclides in the radionuclide composition; (g) Fluctuation of the efficiency of surface radioactivity removal by wipe tests; (h) Fluctuation of the content of natural radionuclides and other radionuclides to be disregarded in the material; (i) Uncertainties associated with instrument calibration; (j) Sampling uncertainty.

For example, the use of an excavator to dig out a volume of contaminated soil may result in some mixing of soil with differing levels of contamination. In this case, the mixing happens as part of the normal material management process. 4.61.

The authorized discharges of liquid effluents described in para. 5.1 are performed under the system of regulatory control. This is conceptually different from clearance, which is a process through which regulatory controls are removed. There are situations where the removal of regulatory control from a liquid may be more appropriate than releasing a material in accordance with an authorized discharge. For example, the clearance of liquids can be used in cases where small amounts of liquid containing low levels of radionuclides are produced, for which the management of a discharge regime is not warranted. There may also be cases where liquids constitute an asset and where there is a commercial interest in reuse or recycling, for example lubrication oils used in pumps, cooling liquids from transformers in nuclear power plants or acids from the manufacturing process of nuclear fuel. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to incinerate certain liquids in a conventional waste incineration plant because of their hazardous properties. In all such cases, clearance may be the best option. For clearance of liquids, the same basic principles given in Sections 2 and 3 of this Safety Guide apply as they do for solid materials. Clearance of liquids needs to be based on the same dose criterion as clearance of solid material (i.e. individual effective doses of the order of 10 µSv in a year). 5.3. There is a fundamental difference between the authorized discharge of liquid effluents and the granting of clearance to a liquid. In the case of discharges, once released, the radionuclides are dispersed in the environment and the possibility for reconcentration of activity in the environmental matrices is extremely low. In contrast, cleared liquids might not be dispersed, and after clearance the activity concentration might even increase (e.g. due to filtration, evaporation, distillation or fractionation). This difference should be taken into account in the derivation of clearance levels for liquids.

81,"ASPECTS OF LIQUIDS RELEVANT TO CLEARANCE 5.4. Liquids have some properties that distinguish them from solid materials with respect to the application of the concept of clearance, as follows: (a) Radionuclides in aqueous liquids or in organic liquids can be easily concentrated (e.g. by evaporation or distillation) so that the initial activity concentration can increase. (b) If the liquid evaporates completely, the residual radionuclides effectively become a source of solid surface contamination. (c) Radionuclides can be accumulated on filters during filtration processes. 5.5. Some types of liquid, including some oils, lubricants, antifreeze agents and other organic substances, often do not have the properties described in para. 5.4, or else they do to a much lesser extent. As a result, the activity concentration in such liquids is less likely to change during subsequent treatment. The main exception is incineration, which can lead to the concentration of certain radionuclides in residues such as ashes or slags. This should be considered in the model used for derivation of clearance levels, as was done in the model in Ref. [5] for solid materials. 5.6. Liquids containing contamination in the form of radionuclides bound to suspended particles can be decontaminated by filtration processes; however, the activity will then concentrate in the residue. A typical example is lubricants, in which abraded particles containing contamination accumulate. 5.7. Several States have chosen to limit clearance to liquids that have been filtered prior to clearance and for which the likelihood of any processes leading to an increase in activity concentration is very small or negligible.

The following options can be considered: (a) The liquids are cleared for any purpose; that is, they can be directly reused, recycled or further treated (e.g. by incineration). This may be the case for oil or lubricants after filtration, which can be directly reused, recycled (through conversion into fuel) or treated (by incineration in a waste incineration plant). (b) The liquids are cleared for a specific process only, for example for treatment by incineration in a conventional waste incineration plant. (c) The liquids are filtered before being cleared. (d) The liquids are cleared for a specified use or for a specified recipient. (e) The clearance of the liquids is subject to limitations, for example in terms of the total or annual quantities. 5.9. Case by case decisions are of considerable importance for the specific clearance of liquids, in particular when aqueous liquids such as diluted acids that have been used in certain processes in nuclear facilities (e.g. hydrogen fluoride in uranium fuel manufacturing) are to be cleared for further use in the chemical industry. Models describing such specific clearance need to consider possible processes of concentration (e.g. when instead of a diluted acid a strong acid is needed) and filtration, including those in water purification plants where many chemical elements are extracted from the water and concentrated in sewage sludge. The chemical toxicity of liquids should be taken into account when deciding if other regulatory controls need to remain after clearance. 5.10. Where the concept of clearance is applied to aqueous liquids, they may subsequently be discharged into a lake, river or sea. As the liquid has already been cleared, no authorization is needed for the discharge (although the approval of the water authorities may still be necessary). In such a case, the model used to derive the clearance levels needs to take into account all relevant pathways in the environment (i.e. dispersion of radionuclides in the water body, effects of sedimentation, and the uses of the water), as described in Ref. [37]. The clearance of liquids may involve similar exposure pathways as the clearance of solid materials (i.e. external irradiation, inhalation, direct ingestion and inadvertent ingestion).

The clearance levels for solid materials provided in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] may also serve as the basis for clearance of some liquids, provided that concentration or filtration processes will not occur after the liquids have been cleared. The model in Ref. [5] that underlies the clearance levels for solid materials covers various scenarios that would also be bounding for reuse, recycling or disposal of liquids (e.g. storage in a large tank giving rise to external gamma radiation; evaporation of the liquid leading to inhalation and ingestion of water sourced from contaminated groundwater). The only scenario not explicitly covered by the models described in Ref. [5] is the release of large quantities of liquids to the environment. As such, the clearance levels provided in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1] could be applied for clearance of non‑aqueous liquids (e.g. oils, lubricants) for reuse, recycling or disposal by incineration.

Special attention should be given to the homogeneity of the liquid and the possibility of deposition of sediments. 5.15. Clearance levels for liquids will usually be expressed in terms of activity concentration for each radionuclide (e.g. in Bq/L). In some cases, for example where liquids or their residues might accumulate in specific locations, it may be more appropriate to determine clearance levels in terms of total activity (i.e. of individual radionuclides or of groups of radionuclides (e.g. in Bq/a)), either in addition to, or instead of, activity concentration clearance levels. Examples of such an approach are provided in Refs [30, 39]. DILUTION OF LIQUIDS BEING CONSIDERED FOR CLEARANCE 5.16. The deliberate dilution of liquids (e.g. with clean water) to comply with clearance levels is generally not acceptable. However, in exceptional cases permission may be obtained from the regulatory body. For example, dilution may be necessary to manage non‑radiation‑related properties, such as pH or salt content, prior to discharge, and this should be taken into account when deciding about clearance. The possibility of subsequent concentration of radionuclides (e.g. in industrial uses or in the environment) should be considered. Dilution of the liquids after clearance will occur at many subsequent stages and should be taken into account in the models used to derive clearance levels. 5.17. A further aspect of dilution is relevant for the clearance of small volumes of liquids, for example residues of radiopharmaceuticals in vials to be disposed of by incineration. Such liquids cannot be readily emptied from the vials (or from other items such as gloves or syringes). In practice, when determining compliance with clearance levels, the total mass (i.e. of the liquid and the containers) should be considered. BACKGROUND RADIATION IN THE CLEARANCE OF LIQUIDS 5.18. As with the clearance of solid materials (see para. 4.54), the clearance of liquids should be based on the radionuclides that originate from the practice in question, and background radioactivity should be disregarded.

85,"6. CLEARANCE OF GASES DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DISCHARGE AND CLEARANCE OF GASES 6.1. Gaseous releases from facilities are usually treated as discharges that are managed in accordance with an authorization (see Requirement 31 of GSR Part 3 [1]). In specific cases where application of the concept of clearance is necessary, for example where reuse of the gaseous material is intended, clearance levels for gases should be calculated on the basis of individual effective doses of the order of 10 µSv in a year. Gases that meet such clearance levels can subsequently be released without an authorization, provided there are no restrictions due to their chemical or other hazardous properties. An example is clearance of nitrogen gas found in a nuclear facility (for use in gloveboxes where radioactive material is handled) for reuse outside the nuclear facility. 6.2. In contrast to liquids, it is unlikely that potentially radioactive gases originating from a facility will constitute an asset for which reuse or recycling could be envisaged. If, however, there is a need to apply the concept of clearance to gases that are to be reused or recycled, then the model used to derive clearance levels should consider the possibility that the concentration of radionuclides in the gas might change (e.g. owing to changes in the pressure or volume of the gas). The pressure of a gas may vary over orders of magnitude, depending on the volume in which it is contained. Exposure scenarios relevant to a compressed gas in a container may be fundamentally different from those for a gas under standard conditions. Examples of clearance levels for gases released from a vent at the side of a building are given in Ref. [30]. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF CONCEPT OF CLEARANCE TO GASES 6.3.

Paragraph I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1] states: “Clearance may be granted by the regulatory body for specific situations, on the basis of the criteria of paras I.10 and I.11 [of GSR Part 3], with account taken of the physical or chemical form of the radioactive material, and its use or the means of its disposal65. Such clearance levels may be specified in terms of activity concentration per unit mass or activity concentration per unit surface area. “65 For example, specific clearance levels may be developed for metals, for rubble from buildings and waste for disposal in landfill sites.” Hence, the radiological basis for specific clearance is the same as for generic clearance (i.e. as described in paras I.10 and I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1]). Examples of specific clearance that have been applied in individual States include scrap metal for recycling (melting), buildings for demolition and waste for disposal in landfill sites. 7.2. The models used to derive generic clearance levels [5] are deliberately conservative so as not to underestimate the possible exposures in all relevant circumstances. There are, however, situations where a generic approach is not suitable, either because a specific exposure scenario is not covered by the generic model or because key parameters describing a specific exposure scenario deviate significantly from the values used in the generic model.

The analysis of a specific situation may show that certain scenarios in the corresponding generic model are not relevant. These scenarios should then be excluded from consideration in the derivation of specific clearance levels. 7.4. The models used to derive specific clearance levels should take into account the same exposure pathways as the generic model described in Ref. [5]. Therefore, external irradiation, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, direct ingestion of small quantities of radionuclides, and ingestion of radionuclides via the food chain and skin contamination should be included. Although based on specific circumstances, the parameters used in the exposure scenarios should be chosen so as to take account of possible variations. For example, if exposure times are expected to vary between 240 and 480 h/a, it would be prudent to use a value of 500 h/a to take into account these variations. 7.5. The use of specific clearance allows specific circumstances within a State (e.g. industrial, environmental, climate related and regulatory requirements) to be taken into account and avoids the inappropriate use of generic clearance levels. Specific clearance levels can be established on a national basis (i.e. in legislation developed by the regulatory body) or in response to an application by one or more operating organizations.

With due consideration of the general criteria for clearance specified in para. I.10(b) of GSR Part 3 [1], the regulatory body may decide (where the national regulatory framework so allows) that the optimum regulatory option is to remove the material from regulatory control by setting or authorizing specific clearance levels. This might also be appropriate for specific materials containing radionuclides at activity concentrations that exceed the generic clearance levels (i.e. in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1]) in order to allow their further management as non‑radioactive materials. In making such a decision, the regulatory body should consider the doses from ‘realistic’ and ‘low probability’ scenarios and the degree of conservatism in the dose estimates, as well as other factors. The mechanism for making such a decision will depend on the nature of the national regulatory framework.

In practice, specific clearance levels are usually expected to be less restrictive than generic clearance levels. This might, however, cause problems if a material cleared on the basis of specific clearance levels is exported to another State where only generic clearance levels (e.g. as provided in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1]) are applied. In such cases, the derivation of specific clearance levels should take into consideration the clearance levels applied in other States to which the material might be sent. Alternatively, specific arrangements should be made in advance with these other States for acceptance of the cleared material. SPECIFIC CLEARANCE AS AN ADDITIONAL OPTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL 7.8. Specific clearance represents an additional option for the management of material (including waste) from authorized facilities and activities as well as from remediation activities after the termination of an emergency. It is part of the application of the graded approach to regulatory control and supports the application of the waste hierarchy, reducing the amount of material to be managed as radioactive waste and increasing the amounts to be reused or recycled. Specific clearance also provides an opportunity for disposal of waste as non‑radioactive instead of radioactive waste. 7.9. When considering whether specific clearance is appropriate, the regulatory body should consider other factors, for example the need for measures at the facilities that receive the cleared material to ensure that exposures to persons are acceptable and protection of the environment is adequate, and whether these measures can be relied on without regulatory oversight. If regulatory oversight is considered necessary to ensure protection and safety, then clearance is not appropriate. In such cases, materials should only be transferred to appropriately authorized facilities. DERIVATION AND USE OF SPECIFIC CLEARANCE LEVELS 7.10. In accordance with para. I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1], specific clearance levels may be derived in terms of activity concentration or surface contamination.

SPECIFIC CLEARANCE AS AN ADDITIONAL OPTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL 7.8.	 Specific clearance represents an additional option for the management of material (including waste) from authorized facilities and activities as well as from remediation activities after the termination of an emergency. It is part of the application of the graded approach to regulatory control and supports the application of the waste hierarchy, reducing the amount of material to be managed as radioactive waste and increasing the amounts to be reused or recycled. Specific clearance also provides an opportunity for disposal of waste as non‑radioactive instead of radioactive waste. 7.9.	 When considering whether specific clearance is appropriate, the regulatory body should consider other factors, for example the need for measures at the facilities that receive the cleared material to ensure that exposures to persons are acceptable and protection of the environment is adequate, and whether these measures can be relied on without regulatory oversight. If regulatory oversight is considered necessary to ensure protection and safety, then clearance is not appropriate. In such cases, materials should only be transferred to appropriately authorized facilities. DERIVATION AND USE OF SPECIFIC CLEARANCE LEVELS 7.10.	In accordance with para. I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1], specific clearance levels may be derived in terms of activity concentration or surface contamination. Clearance levels may also be derived in terms of other appropriate quantities, for example total activity (e.g. in Bq or Bq/a).

89,"a specific set of materials and/or destinations are not automatically applicable to other materials or destinations. 7.11. Specific clearance can take into account the destination and fate of the cleared material; consequently, the derived clearance levels can be less conservative than those used for generic clearance. However, in the derivation of specific clearance levels it should be assumed that the cleared material is handled in the same way as similar non‑radioactive material; that is, clearance should not rely on special radiation protection measures being taken to meet the dose criteria. 7.12. Care should be taken in the derivation and use of specific clearance levels to ensure that cleared material (e.g. metals for melting) can be received at the specified destination (e.g. smelter) without the need for notification or authorization. One means of avoiding this might be to ensure that the specific clearance levels do not exceed the exemption levels for moderate quantities of material specified in table I.1 of GSR Part 3 [1]. In this way, the cleared material can be exempted from the requirement for notification6. 7.13. It may also be necessary to limit quantities of specifically cleared material over a specified time period (e.g. in terms of kilograms or tonnes in a year) in order to meet the conditions embedded in the radiological model for derivation of the specific clearance levels (i.e. number of transports linked to the exposure to the driver) or not to exceed certain limits of the specified destination. 7.14. During processes such as metal smelting, certain radionuclides might concentrate in the dusts and slags, and the activity concentrations in these by‑products might therefore exceed the activity concentrations in the metals. The model used to derive specific clearance levels should take this into account to ensure that the doses from exposure to such dusts and slags do not exceed of the order of 10 µSv in a year. Examples of such models can be found in Refs [5, 29, 40]. SURFACE CONTAMINATION CLEARANCE LEVELS FOR SPECIFIC CLEARANCE 7.15. Surface contamination clearance levels for generic clearance (see paras 4.17–4.22) need to be distinguished from those for specific clearance. 6 If the specified destination is an authorized facility (e.g. a licensed smelter of metals), then specific clearance might not be needed for a delivery of the material to that facility. 55","a specific set of materials and/or destinations are not automatically applicable to other materials or destinations. 7.11.

90,"Surface contamination levels for specific clearance may, for example, be derived for the following: (a) Clearance of metals for melting; (b) Clearance of buildings for reuse; (c) Clearance of buildings for demolition. 7.16. In the various options for specific clearance, surface contamination clearance levels can fulfil different purposes. For example, the limitation of the surface activity on metallic items will protect persons handling these items prior to melting, and the limitation of activity on the surface of buildings will protect persons living or working in such buildings from direct irradiation and from inhalation of resuspended activity due to refurbishment activities. Examples of surface contamination clearance levels for specific clearance of scrap metal for melting are given in Ref. [29]; specific clearance levels for buildings for demolition are given in Ref. [41]. 7.17. Clearance on the basis of surface contamination clearance levels generally applies only to surfaces where the contaminant can be detected by surface measurement techniques and the depth of the contaminant is such that the measurement technique can detect, to a reasonable degree, all the contamination. Surface contamination clearance levels are not suitable for materials such as excavated soil or building rubble7. 7.18. For surfaces where the activity can penetrate into the volume (e.g. building surfaces and permeable ground), it should be specified whether the clearance levels apply only to the top layer (i.e. the actual surface) or to the surface plus part of the volume beneath the surface. Usually, it is a prudent approach to relate surface contamination clearance levels to both the contamination present directly on the surface and the contamination present immediately beneath the same surface area. Further details are given in Ref. [41]. 7 Building rubble to be cleared is usually measured using bulk monitors that can measure several hundred kilograms of material at a time, applying activity concentration clearance levels such as in table I.2 of GSR Part 3 [1]. Buildings that are to be cleared in the form of the standing structure are most often cleared (e.g. for subsequent demolition) using surface related clearance levels like those given in Ref. [41]. The building rubble originating from demolition of these buildings does not have to be subjected to additional clearance measurements to demonstrate compliance with activity concentration clearance levels. 56","Surface contamination levels for specific clearance may, for example, be derived for the following: (a) Clearance of metals for melting; (b) Clearance of buildings for reuse; (c) Clearance of buildings for demolition. 7.16.

91,"7.19. Careful distinction needs to be made between the surface contamination clearance levels and the other uses of surface contamination levels, such as in SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16]. The surface contamination limits specified in para. 508 of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16] are derived for the transport of radioactive material under regulatory control, which is not relevant for clearance, so those values should not be used for clearance purposes. 7.20. Models used for the derivation of surface contamination clearance levels need to consider all exposure pathways associated with the presence of surface contamination. In particular, these include the following: (a) External irradiation from the contaminated surface; (b) Ingestion as a consequence of hand‑to‑mouth transfer of contamination when handling objects; (c) Inhalation as a consequence of resuspension of contamination when handling or machining objects; (d) Skin contamination. 7.21. The same criteria for clearance as specified in paras I.10 and I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1] should be applied when deriving surface contamination levels for specific clearance. In addition, an equivalent dose limit to the skin of 50 mSv in a year should be applied for low probability scenarios, as described in para. 4.4(b). 7.22. If a material has been activated (e.g. the concrete shield around a nuclear reactor or particle accelerator), surface contamination clearance levels such as those provided in Ref. [29] are not applicable. MEETING THE CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO SPECIFIC CLEARANCE 7.23. Specific clearance is applied to a particular material, sometimes for a specified amount and for a particular fate and/or destination of that material: all these conditions are attached to the specific clearance. Such conditions need to be met in order to consider the clearance process complete. For example, scrap metal that was cleared on the condition that it would be melted needs to actually reach a furnace and be melted there, and not be reused in some other way before that point. If mixing with non‑radiological metal is a condition of the specific clearance, the mixing ratio used in the derivation of the specific clearance levels should be respected. Similarly, a building that was cleared on the condition that it would be demolished should not be used in the meantime (e.g. as a temporary office or a workshop). 57","7.19.

92,"7.24. To ensure that the conditions attached to specific clearance are met, it may be necessary to make a formal arrangement between the operating organization that generates the material for clearance and the operating organization of the final destination. Such an arrangement should provide a high level of assurance that the material will not be diverted prior to completion of the clearance process and that the radiation risks are minimized. The practicalities of this should be agreed with the regulatory body. This could include overseeing the transport to the specified destination or requiring receipts to be sent to the facility in which the material was originally cleared that can be reviewed by the regulatory body. If the destination is in a different State and transboundary movement of the specifically cleared material is planned, the clearance process should take that into account so that the material can be accepted for transport and further management (e.g. recycling) in the destination State. 7.25. Specific clearance can therefore be considered a two‑stage process. Stage 1 is the act of clearance when it is confirmed that (a) the material meets the specific clearance levels, (b) the fate or destination is agreed, and (c) a formal agreement exists for the transfer and treatment of the material. Stage 2 is a confirmation, which occurs when evidence is provided that the conditions attached to the specific clearance have been met. 7.26. In the case of specific clearance of scrap metal for melting, the process of dealing with scrap metal in the relevant States will need to be understood, so that the appropriate conditions can be identified. Scrap metal often goes to scrap dealers, who store metals until they have a sufficient quantity of a particular type of metal to sell on to a metal melting company, and there is significant international trade in scrap metal. This type of business is not appropriate for the specific clearance of scrap metal. Instead, arrangements should be made to ensure that scrap metal is sent directly to the specified melting facility. 7.27. In the case of specific clearance of material sent to a landfill, the specificities of the landfill have to be understood and included in the scenarios used to derive the specific clearance levels. The conditions attached should take into account the capacity of the receiving landfill, the activity concentration levels for specific clearance and the leachability of radionuclides from the cleared material into the environment. The post‑closure period for the landfill should also be considered.

In the case of generic clearance, the process may be considered complete once compliance with generic clearance levels has been demonstrated (which usually happens at the facility that generates the material). In contrast, specific clearance may involve conditions on the material reaching a certain destination or end state (e.g. metal cleared for melting has to reach the smelter, waste cleared for disposal has to reach the landfill, buildings cleared for demolition without prior reuse have to be demolished). It might therefore be necessary to consider at what point the removal of regulatory control is also complete (and whether handling of the material prior to completion of the specific clearance would require an authorization by the regulatory body). 7.29. The model used to derive specific clearance levels should explicitly take into account any transport of the material that will occur as part of the clearance process. Specific clearance is required to be based on the same dose criteria as for generic clearance (see para. I.13 of GSR Part 3 [1]).

As such, the transport of material that meets specific clearance levels should normally not be subject to the requirements of SSR‑6 (Rev. 1) [16]; this should be confirmed when specific clearance levels are derived. Similarly, the destination facility should not need an authorization for dealing with the cleared material: this should also be confirmed when deriving specific clearance levels. 8. ENGAGING INTERESTED PARTIES AND ENHANCING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF CLEARANCE 8.1. Although material that is cleared arises within notified or authorized practices, it is likely to be subsequently processed or used by people who are not familiar with radiation protection and who do not understand that the dose criterion for clearance — of the order of 10 μSv in a year (see para. I.11 of GSR Part 3 [1]) — represents a trivial radiation risk. Consequently, it might not be understood why cleared materials can be used without taking any radiation protection measures. 59","7.28.

98,"A.5. Recycling of material or disposal of waste in landfills in a post‑emergency existing exposure situation often cannot use the same dose criteria as for clearance in a planned exposure situation. Instead, different dose criteria may be selected that are more appropriate and that take into account the specificities of the existing exposure situation. Consequently, the term ‘clearance level’ is not appropriate in the context of a post‑emergency exposure situation. This appendix instead uses the term ‘screening level’ for operational use in measurements of activity concentrations in materials and waste. A.6. If recycling of material or disposal of waste in landfills is necessary in a post‑emergency situation, any screening levels should be based on individual effective dose criteria whose values are less than or equal to the selected reference level for the existing exposure situation under consideration. These dose criteria should relate to the subsequent exposures to people from the material or waste to be managed. In such cases, the dose criteria should be specified by the regulatory body or other relevant authority. As an example, a dose criterion for realistic scenarios in the later stage of recovery after an emergency could be of the order of 1 mSv or less in a year (e.g. for doses to workers and the public under normal operations, doses associated with recycling, and doses from groundwater migration following disposal in a landfill). Dose criteria for low probability scenarios, such as intrusion into a landfill site after its closure, should also be specified and would be expected to be greater than or equal to the dose criteria for realistic scenarios. A.7. Hence, for practical applications to support decision making in an existing exposure situation, an approach similar to that of clearance using ‘screening levels’ (in Bq/g) derived from suitable dose criteria is recommended. The regulatory body or other relevant authority should also specify the actions to be taken in cases where screening levels are exceeded. An example of such an approach implemented after the Fukushima Daiichi accident is presented in Annex VIII. 64","A.5.

Therefore, an enveloping approach has been taken where a worker is exposed to a large item, in this case a tool cabinet that has a comparatively large overall surface: two panels (doors and back), six shelves, and two sides, and overall dimensions of 2 m in height, 1 m in width and 0.4 m in depth, leading to a total surface of 8 m2.

Exposure due to inadvertent ingestion during the reuse of a cleared item can occur when the contamination is transferred from the item to the mouth via the hands, for example while eating or smoking.

It is conservatively assumed that ingestion takes place during 200 h/a, with an ingestion rate of 1.2 cm2/h and a transfer of 1% of the surface activity to the hand. Dose from inhalation of contamination from resuspension of activity during the reuse of cleared equipment I–14.

(b) The item can be cleaned or sanded, for example in preparation for painting, leading to resuspension of the surface activity. (c) Repair work such as welding or thermal cutting can be performed, leading to resuspension of the surface activity.

108,"Dose to the skin from the transfer of contamination to the body during the reuse of cleared equipment I–16. During the reuse of a cleared item, the contamination can be transferred to the skin and cause a skin dose, especially from beta radiation. This scenario assumes that the contaminated area of the skin is 0.1 m2, that the exposure time is 1800 h/a and that 1% of the contamination is transferred from the item to the skin. In this scenario, the skin dose is also converted to an effective dose by using the tissue weighting factor for the skin of 0.01.

A further analysis of the two most important exposure pathways — inhalation from manual processing of scrap and external gamma irradiation from using cleared items — was performed in Ref. [I–2] using dedicated stochastic models. These two exposure scenarios are deemed to be especially important, because they involve prolonged close contact with large quantities of scrap or large items, and because the radionuclides associated with contaminated scrap metal are often gamma emitters (e.g. 60Co, 137Cs) or are radionuclides with high inhalation dose coefficients (e.g. nuclides of uranium and plutonium).

111,"I–27. This guideline is to be applied for removing objects from controlled areas. In general, there is no control on the use of objects after their removal, and therefore the removal is similar to the concept of clearance. Clearance is normally based on an assumption of handling a large amount of materials, such as dismantling waste from a nuclear installation, while the removal of objects from controlled areas in planned exposure situations more often involves the handling of many relatively small objects. I–28. The surface contamination levels on small objects being removed from controlled areas that would correspond to the clearance dose criterion of an annual effective dose of the order of 10 µSv or less (for realistic exposure scenarios) were calculated. It was concluded that continued control of objects that have been removed from controlled areas is not warranted from a radiation protection perspective.

In general, there is no control on the use of objects after their removal, and therefore the removal is similar to the concept of clearance. Clearance is normally based on an assumption of handling a large amount of materials, such as dismantling waste from a nuclear installation, while the removal of objects from controlled areas in planned exposure situations more often involves the handling of many relatively small objects. I–28.  The surface contamination levels on small objects being removed from controlled areas that would correspond to the clearance dose criterion of an annual effective dose of the order of 10 µSv or less (for realistic exposure scenarios) were calculated. It was concluded that continued control of objects that have been removed from controlled areas is not warranted from a radiation protection perspective. The applicability of the concept of clearance has, therefore, been demonstrated and included in the guideline.

In both scenarios, the surface contamination levels for 60Co and 137Cs that correspond to the dose criterion of an annual effective dose of 10 µSv were calculated to be 10 Bq/cm2 for both radionuclides. These surface contamination levels for 60Co and 137Cs correspond to readings of 1000 cpm and 2300 cpm, respectively, using a typical Geiger–Müller surface contamination survey meter with a 20 cm2 window, based on Ref. [I–14]. I–30. For high energy gamma emitters, such as 60Co and 137Cs, the surface contamination level that corresponds to the dose criterion of an annual effective dose of 10 µSv significantly depends on the assumed size of the contaminated surface. The same radionuclides may also be key radionuclides for surface contamination measurements of beta radiation. I–31. In developing the guideline, it became clear that surface contamination clearance levels derived for large objects would be too conservative for small objects routinely removed from controlled areas. Instead, separate surface contamination levels are applied for routine control of small objects removed from controlled areas, in accordance with the dimensions of the surface likely to be contaminated.

The model calculations were applied to a number of deterministic scenarios for calculating the annual effective dose resulting from exposure to a typical office item (i.e. a bookcase), considering different scenarios of use and different radionuclides. The scenarios were then used to calculate surface contamination levels that would correspond to an annual effective dose of 10 µSv in a year. I–35. The results of these calculations were then compared with the results of Ref. [I–2]. Differences due to different assumptions for parameters and exposure scenarios were observed. One of the main differences is that the SUDOQU model in Ref. [I–10] considers reduction of the surface activity with time not only through radioactive decay but also through resuspension and transfer of activity to the hands. Similarly, the resuspended activity contributes to the increase in airborne activity concentration and can, in turn, partly redeposit onto the object surface. I–36. It was concluded in Ref. [I–11] that the SUDOQU model for dose assessments was suitable for the clearance of objects from nuclear installations.

The selected landfill site for disposal of the uranium contaminated soil is situated in the province of Antwerp and is intended for hazardous waste. It also accepts waste containing naturally occurring radioactive material. Specific zones of the disposal site will be used for the low level contaminated soil from FBFC International. III–10. An internal impact study [III–5] considered the exposure scenarios for handling 8300 m3 of soil as a worst case, assuming a contamination level of 10 Bq/g Utot.

Table III–2 shows that the most exposed workers will be those involved in the unloading of the soil on the landfill site. It is assumed that workers perform only one of the listed tasks and that the job of unloading would be shared by two workers. Therefore, it was concluded that an activity concentration level of 10 Bq/g Utot in soil would not give an individual annual effective dose in excess of 10 µSv to any of the workers considered.

Nevertheless, these workers are considered as occupationally exposed workers by the operating organization. III–15.

132,"EXAMPLE FROM IAEA PUBLICATION ON SPECIFIC CLEARANCE OF SOLID WASTE FOR DISPOSAL ON LANDFILL SITES III–24. Reference [III–7] provides information on a study of the derivation of specific clearance levels for disposal of material in a landfill. Large amounts of solid material with a low level of radioactivity are encountered in decommissioning projects; consequently, the study started with a focus on the specific clearance of decommissioning waste for disposal in landfills. III–25. For the purpose of the study, a new tool, called ‘Clearance Tool’ was developed for the derivation of specific clearance levels for different types of landfill and, ultimately, for the reuse and recycling of materials from decommissioning projects. The dose criteria and scenarios for the derivation of these clearance levels are based on Ref. [III–8] and IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards [III–9], namely 10 µSv in a year for realistic scenarios and 1 mSv in a year for low probability scenarios. III–26. The derivation of the specific clearance levels focused on radionuclides relevant to nuclear power plants. This annex presents the results for a subset of the radionuclides considered: 90Sr, 99Tc, 106Ru, 131I, 134Cs, 137Cs, 144Ce, 239Pu, 241Pu and 241Am. III–27. A basic set of exposure scenarios was used to describe the disposal of material in an ordinary landfill without any special radiation protection arrangements. The scenarios took into account the exposure of workers that might arise from transport of the material to the site, handling of the material at the landfill, and releases of radionuclides to the atmosphere in the case of a landfill fire. The exposure of members of the public living close to the landfill was also considered. The scenarios included consideration of the consequences of a controlled or uncontrolled release of leachates to groundwater and surface water. III–28. The lifetime of the landfill is divided into two phases — the operational phase and the post‑operational phase — in which a distinction is made between the period during and after institutional control. For the post‑operational phase of a landfill site, a recreational use scenario was considered, including the possibility of small excavations being performed in the landfill. In addition, an intrusion scenario was considered in which houses are built on the site of the original landfill. In this scenario, only the exposure to people living in these houses was considered, as the exposure time would be longer and there would be additional exposure pathways (e.g. ingestion of contaminated garden products), 91","EXAMPLE FROM IAEA PUBLICATION ON SPECIFIC CLEARANCE OF SOLID WASTE FOR DISPOSAL ON LANDFILL SITES III–24.  Reference [III–7] provides information on a study of the derivation of specific clearance levels for disposal of material in a landfill.

A resident living on the landfill after closure and after the end of institutional control was treated as an unlikely scenario. Therefore, for this scenario a dose criterion of 1 mSv in a year was used. III–30. The study considered three generic landfill types: (a) Landfill for inert waste; (b) Landfill for municipal non‑hazardous waste; (c) Landfill for hazardous waste. The different types of landfill were assumed to have different properties in terms of the bottom liner, leachate collection system and top cover. III–31.

This annex is based on the Practical Guide of the Ibero‑American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, developed through the project “Implementation of the Clearance Concept and Criteria for Small Nuclear Installations Handling Radioactive Waste” [IV–1]. IV–2. Certain facilities conducting practices with unsealed or sealed radioactive sources use radionuclides with short and very short half‑lives (less than 100 days). Examples of such facilities are small research laboratories, medical departments and industrial applications in which such radioactive sources are used, processed or stored. The activity of the radionuclides used in such facilities varies in accordance with the practice. For example, for medical purposes, the activity used can vary from less than 1 MBq up to 100 GBq depending on whether the facility is conducting medical research, clinical therapy or diagnostic procedures. Information on unsealed sources and sealed sources and their range of activity per practice can be found in Refs [IV–1, IV–2]. In such facilities, moderate amounts of radioactive waste1 are generated, and this waste needs to be managed to ensure the protection of people and the environment. With a proper methodology, the best option for management of a significant volume of these radioactive wastes could be clearance. IV–3. The facilities considered in this annex are those that have standardized procedures for the safe use of radioactive sources. A standardized methodology for the clearance of material within these practices is a useful means of ensuring the safe management of the radioactive waste by the operating organizations and, at the same time, facilitating the regulatory process, including record keeping, regulatory inspections and verification of compliance with the relevant standards and regulations.

140,"METHODOLOGY FOR THE CLEARANCE OF WASTE IN SMALL FACILITIES AND ACTIVITIES IV–8. The practical methodology presented in this annex for the clearance of waste arising in small facilities and activities consists of the following main steps: (1) Collection and segregation; (2) Measurement or estimation of the activity concentration of the waste; (3) Management options (i.e. storage, decay, clearance, disposal); (4) Record keeping. Step 1: Collection and segregation IV–9. Appropriate collection and segregation of residual radioactive material is an important step of the methodology and is necessary in order to minimize hazards associated with the waste and to facilitate subsequent management of the waste. It is normally better that the waste collection and segregation be performed at the time and place where the waste is generated. This process needs to be suitable for the radionuclide and its half‑life and for the physical and chemical form and other properties of the waste, such as pathogenic or physical hazards (e.g. sharp objects). IV–10. Only one radionuclide is used in each medical procedure; this makes it easy to segregate waste by individual radionuclides [IV–1]. However, any significant presence of other radionuclides resulting from the production process, either as impurities or as decay products, needs to be properly taken into account. IV–11. In some cases, it may be convenient to segregate wastes in accordance with their half‑life, for example wastes with a half‑life of about 10 hours or less, wastes with a half‑life of less than 10 days and wastes with a half‑life of less than 100 days. IV–12. In other cases, the solid wastes can be segregated according to their physical characteristics, such as compactible or non‑compactible, and incinerable or non‑incinerable. IV–13. To ensure adequate collection and segregation, the nuclear medicine facility needs to be provided with suitably labelled containers and bags. Further information on segregation and labelling of wastes in a nuclear medicine facility is provided in Ref. [IV–1]. 98","METHODOLOGY FOR THE CLEARANCE OF WASTE IN SMALL FACILITIES AND ACTIVITIES IV–8.  The practical methodology presented in this annex for the clearance of waste arising in small facilities and activities consists of the following main steps: (1) Collection and segregation; (2) Measurement or estimation of the activity concentration of the waste; (3) Management options (i.e. storage, decay, clearance, disposal); (4) Record keeping.

141,"Step 2: Measurement or estimation of activity concentration of the waste IV–14. The methodology to measure or estimate the activity concentration of the solid waste in a nuclear medicine facility needs to be practical and simple. Such an approach is sufficient for the purposes of clearance in this type of facility owing to the low activities and the short half‑lives involved. IV–15. Once the waste is collected and segregated as described in step 1, a radiological characterization is performed to determine the initial activity concentration or total activity for each waste stream. Different methods for the measurement or estimation of initial activity concentration or initial total activity in the wastes are used depending on the geometry of the waste containers and the properties of the materials or items in the waste. Consequently, each nuclear medicine facility needs to establish its own measurement or estimation procedure relevant to its own circumstances and the technical properties of any equipment used to perform measurements. Further information is provided in Ref. [IV–1], and a method for clearance measurements for medical waste is provided in Ref. [IV–4]. IV–16. The radionuclide and activity involved in each medical procedure, as well as the total activity authorized, are expected to be known with precision. Hence, the residual activity in the waste can be estimated by means of a simple balance of activity and corrections for radioactive decay. However, if impurities or decay products are present in addition to the radionuclides used in the procedure, their contribution needs to be taken into account, as their relative importance can increase significantly over time. Step 3: Management options (storage, decay, clearance, disposal) IV–17.

In addition, the wastes are labelled, and the label should include the radionuclide, activity concentration, date of storage and probable clearance date. IV–22. From Table IV–2, it can be seen that some of the waste need only be stored for a few days before reaching the clearance levels.

The key radionuclide is always included in the selection. This is done in an iterative process. The sums of C/CL for all radionuclides and for selected significant radionuclides are calculated. If the relative difference between the two sums, F1, is less than 10% of the sum of C/CL for all radionuclides, the selection of radionuclides for evaluation is completed. If F1 is more than 10%, one additional radionuclide (with the highest C/CL among the remaining radionuclides) is added to the selection and a new value for F2 is calculated.

Background radiation needs to be measured separately so that it can be subtracted from the results of clearance measurements, as well as being needed for determination of the limit of detection.

The possible variation of the background radiation level therefore needs to be determined and included in the analysis of uncertainties.

The uncertainties associated with materials containing a mixture of radionuclides include those associated with the determination of scaling factors (see paras 3.21 and 3.22) between difficult to measure radionuclides and easy to measure radionuclides. The uncertainty in the determination of a scaling factor is associated with variations in the activity ratios from which it is derived (e.g. as a mean value together with a standard deviation). Usually, scaling factors for key radionuclides will be derived on a conservative basis so that the activity of the difficult to measure radionuclides will not be underestimated, taking into consideration the difference between the mass of samples used for determination of the scaling factors and the total mass of the material to be cleared.

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WIPING EFFICIENCY OF INDIRECT SURFACE ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS VII–11. When surface contamination levels are determined by wipe tests, assumptions on the wiping efficiency need to be made to estimate the level of removable surface contamination. Often, it is conservatively assumed that 10% of the removable activity is transferred to the wipe [VII–5] to take into account that the actual wiping efficiency is hard to determine and will depend on many factors.

167,"SCREENING METHOD APPLIED AFTER THE FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI ACCIDENT FOR RECYCLING OF MATERIAL AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE TO LANDFILL VIII–1. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, a distinction was made between on‑site and off‑site (in relation to the nuclear power plant) in terms of the original location of materials and waste and the target location for recycling or disposal to landfill. Consequently, the possible ways to recycle or dispose to landfill were categorized into three types: (1) from off‑site to off‑site, (2) from on‑site to on‑site, and (3) from on‑site to off‑site. Category 3 has not been undertaken yet in Japan. VIII–2. For category 1, in 2016 the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, which is responsible for regulating off‑site contamination, developed values for activity concentrations for recycling of the removed soil. This is an example of recycling of material generated off the site, implemented under Ref. [VIII–1]. The Ministry of the Environment of Japan defined waste with activity concentrations above 8000 Bq/kg of 134Cs and 137Cs as ‘designated waste’, for which the national government is responsible for treatment under Ref. [VIII–1]. The Ministry of the Environment also established a procedure for cancelling this designation when the activity concentration of the designated waste is reduced to 8000 Bq/kg or less owing to radioactive decay. The cancellation of the designation allows for disposal of the waste in landfills. This is not the same as clearance, because the waste is disposed of under the regulatory controls specified in Ref. [VIII–2]. VIII–3. For category 2 (on‑site to on‑site), in 2017 the Japan Atomic Energy Agency examined the activity concentration of waste generated in the nuclear power plant for recycling on the site, which is under regulatory oversight by the Nuclear Regulation Authority of Japan.

The Ministry of the Environment of Japan established the Technology Development Strategy for Volume Reduction and Recycling of Removed Soil in April 2016, towards the final disposal of removed soil outside the Fukushima Prefecture. As part of this strategy, the Ministry of the Environment established a basic concept for the safe use of recycled soil, including protection of recovery workers who handle the soil as well as of the public, in June 2016. VIII–6. In the basic concept, it is clarified that the use of the recycled soil is limited to uses that are intended to last for a long time period and are part of public projects managed by the public authority (e.g. for basic structural material of banking for coastal levees, for disaster prevention purposes on beaches, for road construction). The recycled soil has to be used by the appropriate organization in accordance with the criteria established in Ref. [VIII–1], with exposures from recycled soil being further restricted by shielding using soil covering to ensure the additional exposure from the material is below 1 mSv in a year for workers and the public. The safety assessment by the Ministry of the Environment considered various exposure scenarios to ensure that the exposures to workers and public were 1 mSv in a year or less. Later, the concept was extended to the management of other materials, when facilities were constructed using the recycled materials. In such cases, the appropriate thickness of shielding was ensured in order to meet the same dose criterion. VIII–7. Various activity concentration criteria below 8000 Bq/kg have been derived (e.g. 7000, 6000, 5000 and 4000 Bq/kg), in accordance with the purpose of the recycling, the shielding conditions and the annual working time for the use of the recycled soil. The value of 8000 Bq/kg is the same as the concentration level given in Ref. [VIII–1] as a screening level for decision making on exemption from regulatory requirements in an existing exposure situation (see annex II to IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSG‑17, Application of the Concept of Exemption [VIII–3]).

170,"VIII–11. The activity concentration of material for recycling for restricted use on the site is estimated using a case by case approach, within the context of decommissioning activities at the site as part of an existing exposure situation. This approach is based on the following basic concepts: (a) The recycling of material on the site should not lead to an undue increase in the effective dose to persons on the site, nor should it prevent future decommissioning activities. (b) The recycling of material should not lead to an undue radiation risk off the site, taking into account a hypothetical member of the public immediately outside the site boundary. VIII–12. Figure VIII–1 shows the procedure for estimating the activity concentration of material for recycling on the site. As a first step, the activity concentration in material to be recycled that would give rise to an additional dose rate of 1 µSv/h due to the recycling is determined. A dose rate of 1 µSv/h corresponds to the minimum dose rate on the site, as measured in air at a height of 1 m from the ground surface. The additional effective doses for workers closest to recycled material are not to exceed 2 mSv in a year (10% of the dose limit for workers). There are also two criteria for the protection of the public outside the site boundary. The first criterion is an effective dose along the boundary of less than 1 mSv in a year from all radiation sources on the site after the recycling. The second criterion is that the activity concentrations in groundwater for radionuclides migrated from recycling material do not exceed the operational target value for the boundary between the site and the ocean. VIII–13. In accordance with the procedure described in para. VIII–12, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency calculated the activity concentrations for recycling material for restricted use for road construction and for the base of concrete buildings on the site [VIII–4, VIII–5].

One of the principal criteria for clearance in relation to radionuclides of artificial origin is that in reasonably foreseeable circumstances the effective dose expected to be incurred by any individual due to the cleared material is of the order of 10 μSv or less in a year (see para. I.11 of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards [IX–1]). IX–2. There are five components to the practical application of clearance, each of which includes a degree of conservatism, as follows: (a) Application of the dose criterion for clearance to an individual practice; (b) Conversion from the dose criterion to activity concentration (Bq/g); (c) Margins associated with practical clearance measurements; (d) Taking account of multiple radionuclides — radionuclide composition and summation rules; (e) Activity distribution in cleared material. APPLICATION OF THE DOSE CRITERION FOR CLEARANCE TO AN INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE IX–3. The phrase ‘of the order of 10 µSv or less in a year’ is intended to be considered as a trivial dose. In this context, International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 104 [IX–2] uses the phrase “some tens of microsieverts per year”1. A lower boundary value of 10 µSv in a year was used for the derivation of generic clearance levels, since an individual could be exposed to more than one cleared material. Given the wide range of clearance practices and scenarios, with many different representative persons, and the low probability that individuals will be exposed to multiple cleared materials, this approach is likely to be conservative. 1 This is intended to cover the range 10–100 µSv in a year (see para. 67 of Ref. [IX–2]). 123","ILLUSTRATION OF CONSERVATISM IN THE CLEARANCE PROCESS IX–1.

175,"CONVERSION FROM THE DOSE CRITERION TO ACTIVITY CONCENTRATION IX–4. Scenarios are used to derive activity concentration values for each radionuclide that correspond to the dose criterion for clearance. Many scenarios are considered, with different representative persons. The model used for these scenarios includes two principal groups of parameters: parameters representative of specific scenarios (e.g. duration of exposure, source–person geometry, resuspension factors) and generic parameters (e.g. environmental transfer factors, dose per unit intake). The number of parameters used can vary from four up to a maximum of around 12 (when environmental transfers are involved). The parameter set has to be chosen carefully to avoid overconservativism. IX–5. It is important to ensure that the parameters chosen are relevant for the representative person; for example, parameters for an adult might not be sufficiently protective for non‑adults. MARGINS ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTICAL CLEARANCE MEASUREMENTS IX–6. The derived activity concentration values are usually established as legally binding values (clearance levels) in national regulations. To ensure compliance, operating organizations will usually incorporate a degree of conservatism in the programme of clearance measurements. TAKING ACCOUNT OF MULTIPLE RADIONUCLIDES — RADIONUCLIDE COMPOSITION AND SUMMATION RULES IX–7. There may be several radionuclides within a material identified for clearance, accounted for by the summation rules described in para. I.14 of GSR Part 3 [IX–1]. In deriving clearance levels, different radionuclides may have different representative persons to consider, so the exposures might not be strictly additive.

Experience shows that it is virtually impossible to have a consistently uniform waste stream at the maximum allowed activity concentration, and the average activity concentration is usually significantly below the maximum allowed. CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF CONSERVATISMS IX–9. The conservatisms in the five components of the clearance process accumulate in a multiplicative manner. In broad terms, the overall level of conservatism in some cases could exceed one order of magnitude. IX–10. Given the level of overall conservatism in the clearance process, as described in this annex, and noting that clearance is an important means of applying a graded approach to protection, it is important that reasonable steps be taken to reduce the degree of conservatism. In practice, for generic clearance, the main ways in which overconservatism can be avoided are in the clearance measurement programme and the approach to the activity distribution in cleared materials. Specific clearance, by definition, is also a means of avoiding overconservatism in the application of dose criteria to individual practices and in the conversion to activity concentration clearance levels.
